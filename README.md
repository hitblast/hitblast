### Hi!

Honestly, GitHub doesn't seem to be the best place to provide a personal intro, but hey, I'm Anindya (he/him) and I'm a student who also happens to write a lot of code. I'm also an artist by passion [currently doing pixel art].

As some wise person once told, selling the shovels is better than digging the gold. Thus, I love making tools and libraries. I'm the core maintainer of [avro.py](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py), [cutler](https://cutlercli.github.io) and a lot of other projects which enable users and developers to do various things.

I'm also into tinkering with operating systems, as I make a lot of OS-specific programs. [Alter](https://hitblast.github.io/Alter) is one of them, which enables macOS users to change their app icons with ease.

Consider [viewing my blogfolio](https://hitblast.github.io) if you're interested in reading, or, reach out via my <a href="https://discord.gg/ydH7hHdX8k">Discord server</a> for discussing all things software.
