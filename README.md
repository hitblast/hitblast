GitHub isn't the best place for an intro, but here's mine:

Core maintainer of various projects including [avro.py](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py); a Python library enabling thousands of devs to include Bengali localization their code. Also currently the maintainer of an UWP project named [cutler](https://cutlercli.github.io); a tool to automate macOS setup, and several
other mini side-projects. I love to obsess over how my code reflects my mental conventions, though every line of code is a liability anyway.

Consider [viewing my blogfolio](https://hitblast.github.io) if you're interested in reading more about the things I try, the code I write and the life I log into everyday.
