### ðŸ”¨ðŸ‘€ Hi!

I'm Anindya (he/him), currently working as a student and an OSS developer. I'm the core maintainer of various projects including [avro.py](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py), a Python library enabling thousands of developers to write Bengali localizations for their code. I also love making and tinkering with OS-specific tools, such as [cutler](https://cutlercli.github.io), [Alter](https://hitblast.github.io/Alter) and [drs](https://github.com/hitblast/drs).

I love art, especially pixel art. I also love occasional [blog-writing](https://hitblast.github.io).
