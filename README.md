### Hi!

Honestly, GitHub doesn't seem to be the best place to provide personal introductions, but I'm Anindya (he/him) and I'm a student who also happens to write a lot of code. I'm also an artist by passion currently doing pixel art every now and then.

I'm currently working as the maintainer of [cutler](https://cutlercli.github.io), a macOS setup pipeline automation tool that is still growing (I'm bad at advertising work; should be the case since I'm not a sales guy). I'm also the developer of [Alter](https://hitblast.github.io/Alter) and some other side-projects such as [defaults-rs](https://github.com/hitblast/defaults-rs). By this time you've probably figured out that I'm a tinkerer [since most of these are macOS-based projects], and I love experimenting with macOS and Linux.

Reach out via my <a href="https://discord.gg/ydH7hHdX8k">Discord server</a> for discussing all things software. <br>
