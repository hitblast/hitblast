GitHub isn't the best of places for intros, but hey, I'm Anindya, a student who also happens to be writing a lot of code.

I'm the core maintainer of [avro.py](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py), a Python library enabling thousands of devs to write Bengali content in their apps. I've also created some handy tools, namely [cutler](https://cutlercli.github.io) for macOS and [Alter](https://hitblast.github.io/Alter). By their outlook, you can surely say I'm a tinkerer of OSs.

Programming has enabled me to explore parts of my imagination I previously found locked behind forbidden walls, but I'm currently sharing my experiences as well.

Consider [viewing my blogfolio](https://hitblast.github.io) if you're interested in reading.
